I have 10-years of experience in software quality assurance divided by 2 cities (Kraków and Gdańsk) and 3 companies. I had pleasure to work for successful startup, middle-sized company with cloud product, and large company with product used by 30k customers. I like to implement simple solutions that make a difference. My motto is “Make work productive and enjoyable for myself and others, especially by means of automation.”
