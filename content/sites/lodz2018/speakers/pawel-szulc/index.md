  "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." Our industry is only 70 years old and we've already managed to repeat history few times. Curry and Howard think they've found a way to workaround this issue, but Russel and Whitehead said they tried that already and Godel spoiled all the fun. Dr. Kunth however bet $3,372,548 on that idea, so who knows?
