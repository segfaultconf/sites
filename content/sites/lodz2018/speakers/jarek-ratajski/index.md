Jarek Ratajski - Java Developer since 1999

I love programming since my first line of code I did on the C64 in Basic. Somewhere in 90ties I've switched from C++ to java and spent then 18 Years developing JavaEE software working for various companies and projects.

Now I work for Engenius in Switzerland being Java developer at banks during the days and Scala/ScalaJS open sources hacker at nights.
