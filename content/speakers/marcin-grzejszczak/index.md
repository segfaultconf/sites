# Abstract

Is your legacy application talking to a service that is never up and running on your shared testing environment? Does your company waste a lot of time and money on regression testing only to see that, yet again, someone has created a typo in the API? Enough is enough. Time to fix this problem using contract tests!

In this presentation you’ll see how to migrate a legacy application to work with stubs of external applications. We’ll show different ways of increasing your test reliability by writing adding contract tests of your API. You’ll see the difference between producer and consumer driven contracts.
