# Bio

Java Developer, Solution Architect, Team Leader, currently in Delivery Manager role, with little appreciation to any of job titles. Focused more on solving problems, regardless if soft or tech in nature. In free time building communities, speaking at events, coding and trying to come back to blogging. After working around a decade in software industry, I’ve seen a bit, and try to share what I’ve learned about programming and management. Always with opinion, but open to discussion, stay strong and argue :) Despite using Outlook and Excel on daily basis, I’m still developer at heart with couple of IDE’s installed on my machine.
